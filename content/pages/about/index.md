I'm embedded developer in South Korea. But personally, I like to study various fields of programming. This blog is for personal study. I hope that the blog content will be helpful to many people. if there are any errors in the blog content, I would appreciate it if you let me know.

This blog is not my pure creation, but was created with reference to <a href="https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-personal-blog"> greg lobinski's starter</a>. I like this starter so I wanted to use original, but it only work on Gatsby v1. So I port this starter to gatsby v2 with some changes. Thank greg lobinski for providing a beautiful design starter as open source.
