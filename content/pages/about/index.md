Hello, I'm Junsu Kim

I mainly handle embedded development and occasionally back-end development
depending on the needs. I have been developing IoT(NB-IoT, LoRa) communication
products using the Texas Instruments MSP430 series for five years.

Currently, I am working on bluetooth healthcare products using the Nordic nRF series.
